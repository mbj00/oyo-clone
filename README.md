## OYO Website Clone

 The OYO website clone is built using Next.js for both frontend and backend, with MongoDB as the database.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Features

Search: Users can search for hotels based on various criteria like location, date, price, etc.
Compare: Compare multiple hotels side by side to make an informed decision.
Filter: Apply filters to narrow down the search results according to preferences such as price range, amenities, etc.
Book: Users can book hotels directly through the website.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
